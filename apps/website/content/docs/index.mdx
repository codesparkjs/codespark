Codespark is a React component playground for documentation sites, component libraries, and interactive tutorials.

## Why Codespark?

Traditional documentation has limitations:

- **Static code blocks** - Users can only read, not interact
- **External sandboxes** - Popular playground like CodeSandbox requires context switching
- **Manual setup** - Each demo needs boilerplate configuration
- **Stale examples** - Code snippets become outdated without validation

Codespark solves these by providing:

- **Live editing** - Modify code and see results instantly
- **Inline preview** - Code and preview side-by-side
- **Auto dependency resolution** - No manual configuration needed
- **Multiple integrations** - Works with React, MDX, and markdown

## Features

- Modular architecture with highly customizable component styles
- Components using popular TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui as the design system
- Real-time preview with hot reloading
- Automatic dependency resolution via esm.sh
- Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- MDX and remark plugin integration
- Rollup/Vite plugin for build-time processing
