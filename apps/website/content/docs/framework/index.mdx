## What is Framework?

`@codespark/framework` is the core package of CodeSpark that handles code parsing, transformation, and rendering. It provides a unified API for converting code blocks into interactive playgrounds across different output formats.

## Key Capabilities

- **Code Parsing** - Analyzes source code and extracts metadata, dependencies, and configuration
- **Dependency Resolution** - Automatically resolves and bundles external dependencies via esm.sh
- **Multi-format Output** - Generates output for React components, static HTML, or Markdown
- **Extensible Architecture** - Supports custom plugins to extend parsing and transformation behavior

## How it Works

The framework processes code through a transformation pipeline:

1. **Parse** - The source code is parsed to extract metadata, imports, and component definitions
2. **Analyze** - Dependencies are identified and resolved from the import statements
3. **Transform** - Code is transformed into an executable format with injected runtime helpers
4. **Generate** - The final output is generated based on the target framework (React, HTML, Markdown)
5. **Render** - The components from `@codespark/react` will consume what is generated from last step and render the code in preview sandbox

Each step in the pipeline can be customized through plugins, allowing you to extend or modify the default behavior.

## When to Use

Use `@codespark/framework` when you want to integrate CodeSpark with a new language framework or output format. For example:

- **Markdown** - Render interactive playgrounds in Markdown-based documentation
- **HTML** - Generate standalone HTML pages with embedded playgrounds
- **Other frameworks** - Extend support to Vue, Svelte, or any other UI framework
