In addition to React syntax, Codespark also supports markdown rendering.

## Installation & Usage

To render markdown syntax, you need to install the markdown framework package and pass the `framework` prop to the component.

```npm
npm install @codespark/framework
```

```tsx
import { markdown } from '@codespark/framework/markdown';

<Codespark framework={markdown} />;
```

## Markdown Framework

Once the framework is configured, simply pass your markdown code to the `code` prop to preview it.

```tsx preview
import { markdown } from '@codespark/framework/markdown';
import { Codespark } from '@codespark/react';

export default function App() {
  return <Codespark framework={markdown} name="index.md" code="# Hello World" tailwindcss={false} />;
}
```

<Callout title="Note">
You need to change the `name` suffix to `.md` to enable markdown syntax highlighting in the editor.

And you also need to disable Tailwind CSS by setting `tailwindcss={false}`, because Tailwind CSS normalizes default element styles with [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight).

## More Syntax Support?

Codespark currently has built-in support for the following frameworks:

- React
- Markdown
- MDX

If you want to customize other frameworks, please refer to the [Framework](/docs/framework) documentation. Pull requests are welcome!
