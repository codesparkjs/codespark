description: Build-time plugins that enhance Codespark integration with your development workflow.
---

Codespark provides official plugins that integrate with popular build tools and content processing pipelines. These plugins enable static analysis, dependency collection, and automatic component transformation at build time.

## Available Plugins

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@codespark/plugin-rollup` | Rollup/Vite plugin for static dependency analysis |
| `@codespark/plugin-remark` | Remark plugin for MDX code block transformation |

## Plugin Categories

### Build Tool Plugins

**[@codespark/plugin-rollup](/docs/plugin/rollup)** integrates with Rollup and Vite to perform static analysis during the build process. It automatically collects dependencies and local definitions used by `createWorkspace` calls, enabling seamless workspace creation from React components without runtime overhead.

Key features:
- Static dependency analysis at build time
- Automatic collection of local definitions and imports
- TypeScript path alias resolution
- Zero runtime cost for dependency resolution

### Content Plugins

**[@codespark/plugin-remark](/docs/plugin/remark)** transforms fenced code blocks in MDX documents into interactive Codespark components. It enables documentation authors to create live code playgrounds using simple markdown syntax.

Key features:
- Transform code blocks with `codespark` directive into `<Codespark />` components
- Support for multi-file workspaces via consecutive `file` blocks
- Automatic attribute parsing (strings, booleans, numbers)
- Separate directives for editor-only and preview-only modes

## Combining Plugins

For documentation sites that use both MDX content and programmatic workspace creation, you can use both plugins together:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import remarkCodespark from '@codespark/plugin-remark';
import codespark from '@codespark/plugin-rollup';
import mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    codespark(),
    mdx({
      providerImportSource: '@codespark/react',
      remarkPlugins: [remarkCodespark]
    })
  ]
});
```
